TIT198260501;Diego Portales.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260501;Diego Portales was a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesman and entrepreneur who played a pivotal role in shaping the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state and government politics in the 19th century, delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state for almost a century. Portales influential political stance included unitarianism, presidentialism and conservatism which led to consolidate $COUNTRY$ as a constitutional authoritarian republic with democracy restricted to include only upper class men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260502;Diego Portales has been assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260502;The war against our northern neighboors was not welcomed by all in $COUNTRY$. Instead of promoting national unity, the liberals have used the war to critizise Portales and his ruling policy. Last week he had ordered the execution of 3 liberals in the town of Curicó, and today a rebel group of soldiers captures Portales and executed him in Quillota. The whole country is in chaos and expecting us to make an official statement. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260503;Revolution is in the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260503;The resignation and self-exile of General Bernardo O'Higgins in 1823 did not put an end to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political infighting. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political scene divided itself into two groups that were already embrionary during the independence days. One group was mainly composed by the remains of the colonial aristocracy, and defended the ideas of a strong central government, respect of tradition and a strong support for the Catholic Church called the Pelucones. And on the other end of the spectrum we had the Pipiolos who proposed a small government and freedom of trade. Now that the Pipiolos  and liberals are gaining more power they have started to push major social reforms, polarizing the population. The Pelucones have control of the newspapers are using them to push the situation to a boiling point. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260504;A new constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260504;After almost three years of assassination attempts and hurling insults at each other, the political parties of $COUNTRY$ have agreed to sit down and find an agreement. From this agreement we will write a new Constitution that will put an end to the civil war and will hopefully be one of the most long-lived constitutions of Latin America. Representatives from all parties have made sure that it can be used to endorse both an authoritarian presidentialist system or an oligarchic parliamentary system down the road. What kind of government do the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens need?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260505;La cuestión del sacristán.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260505;Bishop Rafael Valdivieso, dean of the Metropolitan Cathedral of $CAPITAL$, fired a sacristan named Pedro Santelices. Apparently he invited some friends for a meeting at the parrish, but the Holy Wine got the better of them and a stone destroyed the skylight! However, Pedro raised the issue to the religious tribunal of La Serena, who ruled in his favor. Unhappy with the result, the Bishop is now seeking our support to intervene since he's going to raise the issue to The Supreme Court of Justice. Intervening will have political consequences, but it will appease the ecclesiastic authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260506;Loss of support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260506;Many citizens in $COUNTRY$ are outraged by your support of the Bishop in what most see as a religious matter. Even your own supporters are critizing your administration for not respecting the separation of the powers of the State and allowing the Church to openly question the Supreme Court. The issue is all over the newspapers and our political party has been permanently divided and radicalized. You have lost the support of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260507;Ley de inmigración selectiva.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260507;The port of Valparaíso has become one of the most important centers of commerce in the southern hemisphere. It is the first major port after the dangerous Cape Horn that unites the Atlantic of the Pacific and most immigrant ships stay there for a few days before resuming their travel north. Vicente Pérez Rosales, one of our brightest advisors, has devised an innovative plan to convince them to settle in southern $COUNTRY$ instead of continue their travel. Other countries may not be happy about us implementing this policy, but it's well worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260508;Siempre vencedor, jamás vencido.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260508;Our neighboors seem to have forgotten how bravely we fought by their side against the spanish, and some are suggesting that it's because our army is falling behind in the arms race. One of our officers insists that a reminder of our might is long overdue, and tells us that the british have developed a new type of gun that greatly outmatches anything we have seen on this side of the ocean. He also mentioned that there's several british investors who feel than an armed $COUNTRY$ is in their best interest as well. Unless we want to change the army's motto, we should make this investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260509;The Liberal Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260509;A lot have changed since the Civil War tore our country apart decades ago. While the new constitution did bring the reforms the people wanted, there's a liberal minority that feel the current government's constant political persecution is unaccetable. Arms re being stolen regularily from some our supply depots, and we suspect some officers may be involved. We could try to avert the problem by siding with the radical faction, but going against the ruling party is going to make us look weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TIT198260510;The Liberation of Perú.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260510;Following the Battle of Maipú and the subsequent liberation of $COUNTRY$, the Ejército Libertador began the preparations for an amphibious assault force to liberate Peru. Originally the costs were to be assumed by both $COUNTRY$ and Argentina, however our government ended up assuming most of costs of the campaign since Bernardo O'Higgins was convinced that $COUNTRY$ would never be safe until Perú was free of the Spanish yoke. It was determined that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$-argentinian land army was going to be led by José de San Martín, whilst the navy was to be commanded by admiral "lord" Thomas Alexander Cochrane while Bernardo O'Higgins would remain in $COUNTRY$ as Supreme Director of the Republic. We will not stop until all our latinamerican brothers are free! We will live with honor or die with glory! Those who are brave will follow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260511;Birth of the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260511;The war is over, and we stand stronger than ever before. For the first time in history we are able to make our own decisions and are able to truly choose our own rulers. And while the war did help us realize what it truly means to be a citizen, it also allowed us to see that each of us has different needs. The Church constantly meddles with the state, the educated higher classes ask for special treatment while the poorer artisans strive to make ends meet. Life is harsh in the fields and there's simply no money to improve their situation, while soldiers are left wondering if our brothers will remain friendly now that we've freed them. Our people have proven there's no one like them on the battlefield... But will they be able to prove they can manage a country by themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260512;The Bolivian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260512;Bolivian newspapers have always said bad things about $COUNTRY$, but this is getting out of hand. Politicians are using the printing press to rally support for their party based solely on xenophobic rants about $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens violating the "rights" of bolivians living in $COUNTRY$. Even the president jumped on the bandwagon and other countries are beginning to doubt that leaving Bolivia without sea was a reasonable solution to the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TIT198260513;The Monroe Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DSC198260513;The free and independent condition which we have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. Or so say the americans. In simpler words, they fear that without their help we are likely to be re-conquered by a coalition of European Powers. They claim that America is for the americans! Most people think we should support them, but others fear this is just a concealed form of Imperialism. Whatever our decision, it will have long-term consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
