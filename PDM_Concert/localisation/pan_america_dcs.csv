liberation_of_mendoza_title;The liberation of Mendoza;;;;;;;;;;;;x #true story brah. To this day, they are still mocked by porteños for their "chilean" accent.
liberation_of_mendoza_desc;Mendoza was founded by chileans and remained part of the Capitanía General de $COUNTRY$ under spanish rule for over two centuries. Later, when the Virreinato de La Plata was created on 1776 $COUNTRY$ and all it's lands were transferred to the argentinans. At this point Buenos Aires decided that Mendoza and all of our land east of the Andes would remain under argentinian rule. Today, we have reverted this decision. From now on we will march with our mendocinian brothers. Once again we will fight for freedom side by side under the same flag.;;;;;;;;;;;x

conquest_of_atacama_title;By reason or by force;;;;;;;;;;;;x #Sadly, this is true. Peruvians wore black clothes on the day of their national holidays to protest for the ban.
conquest_of_atacama_desc;The desert of Atacama is finally under chilean control. While most of the population is very happy to be under our benevolous rule, large amounts of bolivians and peruvians make no attempt to conceal their contempt and some even dare to question our right to hold these lands. In light of the current events, we have decided that all citizens are forbidden to celebrate foreign holdays and shall sing our national anthem before any public act. They will all become chilean, by reason or by force.;;;;;;;;;;;x
monroe_doctrine0_title;The Monroe Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
monroe_doctrine0_desc;If we want to remain free, the New World and the Old World are to remain distinctly separate spheres of influence, for they are composed of entirely separate and independent nations. The occasion has been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. America is for the americans!;;;;;;;;;;;x
